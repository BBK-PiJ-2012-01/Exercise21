Team project - making a spambot!

WebPageImpl to-do list:

 - finally clause in getContents crashes (throws NullPointerException
because inputStream is null)

 - Timeout on downloading large files?  Can either do this in WebPageImpl or CrawlerImpl.
 If there's a way for URL class to do this then use that.

 - Check that URL points to an html file before opening it?

 - It is normal for webpages to have bad links.  Can we change it so
 we don't print a stack trace every time we find one?  (it's in getContents)

 - Make a test class!!!  The main method should only be used for interactive
 testing (which probably isn't needed).

 - Add @Override to all methods overriding abstract methods from WebPage

 - Remove javadoc strings from methods overriding abstract methods from
 WebPage (javadoc automatically uses the interface's comments unless
 overidden in the subclass)

 - Add javadoc to all non-overriden methods and to the class
